# Prince Documentation

This is the repository of the [Prince documentation](https://www.princexml.com/doc/),
built with the [Docusaurus v1](https://v1.docusaurus.io/) framework.

The CSS properties are however stored *outside* of the Docusaurus framework,
in order to preserve the XML format for the properties' documentation, which is
located in `./website/properties`.

The properties need a special, preliminary step to be created, before creating
the Docusaurus documentation - you first need to run `make` in the
`./website/properties` folder.

There are some little requirements for this:
* The [Jing](https://github.com/relaxng/jing-trang) RELAX NG validator
* Python
* the xsltproc XSLT processor

(Hint: If *really* need be, you could do without Jing, just fix your Makefile.)

Also the rasterized Page Region image is generated outside of the Docusaurus
framework - you first need to run `make` in the `./website/samples` folder.
Having Prince installed is a requirement.

Both makefiles are called from the Makefile in the `./website` folder. To start
the fully set up documentation, instead of just `yarn start`, you run
the following command from the `./website` folder:

```
    $ make && yarn start
```
