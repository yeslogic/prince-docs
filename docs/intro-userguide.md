Prince is an application for converting HTML and XML documents into PDF files by applying Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
HTML and XML are seamlessly transformed into documents you can print, download and archive.

Prince supports all the main Web Standards:

-   HTML, XHTML, XML, SVG
-   Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
-   JavaScript / ECMAScript
-   JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, WebP, AVIF

To install Prince, follow the [Installation Guide](installing.md), else
proceed to the [User Guide](styling.md).

After an introduction to [styling](styling.md) with Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS), the specifics of styling for [paged media](paged.md) are being analyzed.
CSS [generated content](gen-content.md) is used extensively to add all the
necessary elements for paged media, such as page numbering and page headers
and footers.

Finally, the [scripting](javascript.md) and [graphical](graphics.md)
capabilities of Prince are explored.

After a [Tips and Tricks](cookbook.md) section, a [Help](help.md) section
attempts to address common problems.

Next we will analyze how Prince works: the [input](prince-input.md) it
takes, and the [output](prince-output.md) it produces, and the configuration
options for its [networking](prince-networking.md) and
[server integration](server-integration.md) capabilities.

Last but not least, we document the extensions that are most requested
by publishers and offered by [Prince for Books](prince-for-books.md).
